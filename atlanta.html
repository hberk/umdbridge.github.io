													<td>Without a doubt, travelling to Atlanta for the NABC was one of the highlight of my summer. Though I had only been playing for around a year, the people with whom I played were friendly and welcoming, and I immensely enjoyed playing in both the collegiate and individual events. I felt grateful to be included in such a passionate community. I only hope to continue learning and improving as a player, so I can contribute both to my collegiate team and the game itself. Overall, this was a highly positive experience, and not one I will soon forget.</td>

													<td>I had a really great time playing bridge in Atlanta! To be honest, my only regret is that I didn’t play enough. I wish I had played in the individual tournament and in a few more of the midnight games. I thought it might be strange playing against other students, but I actually quite enjoyed it. Everyone was friendly, and it was fun meeting people my age who also liked bridge. My favorite part of trip was putting to use the stuff I learned over the summer in preparation. I also feel pretty lucky that I got to go on the trip with such amazing teammates!</td>

													<td>Having the chance to play in the Collegiate Bridge Bowl in Atlanta, Georgia this past summer was truly a dream I didn’t know I had. Having played bridge not very seriously on and off for a few years, I never really planned on doing much more than just hanging out and playing cards with friends, but this opportunity opened my eyes to the fun of playing at a higher level and competing in events. Throughout the 3 day event there were numerous opportunities to play bridge, bond with your team, and even meet new people. It was really cool being in this environment where you have this common talking point with everyone you bump into.<br/><br/>
													When I arrived I was expecting to play in the Collegiate Bridge Bowl, but I didn’t realize how many other events there were at the Summer North American Bridge Championships. My partner and I were able to enter some smaller side events which gave us our first opportunity to try a different bidding system. Trying a new bidding system was probably the most interesting thing I had experienced in bridge to that day. I was fascinated by the different ways you could convey information, and because of this trip my partner and I ended up learning a new system for our regular play in the future.<br/><br/>
													Now don’t get me wrong, playing bridge was fun, but the experience would not have been what it was if it weren’t for the people there. Everywhere I looked I was surrounded by people competing in the NABC. When I went to lunch, I saw people. When I was waiting for my matches to start, I saw people. And at the end of the day when I was ready to relax, I got to wind down with my teammates feeling like we accomplished something together.  Going into the event I wasn’t expecting to really talk to anyone outside of my team, but after meeting new people and making new friends I feel foolish for thinking that.<br/><br/>           	Being able to attend the Collegiate Bridge Bowl last summer was such a great experience. We may not have won, but this experience as a whole was better than other wins I’ve had in the past. I think I speak for most of my team when I say we weren’t the most driven to get into this tournament. Our team atmosphere last year really felt like it would be cool if we won the travel package, but I’m not sure how passionate anyone was to qualify. After having attended, I can say without a doubt my team is very passionate about it now, and we plan on qualifying again next year.</td>

													<td>Kevin</td>
													<td>As someone who had only been playing Bridge for a year, going to Atlanta showed me a whole world and culture that I had no idea existed. To me Bridge only existed in our once a week club meetings where our president would teach us the basics, but after seeing the community in Atlanta I now know just how deep the rabbit hole goes. I learned more about Bridge there than I did the whole year prior, and I had an amazing time doing it. Bonding with my teammates was tremendously fun, and I’d like to think I’ve formed some friendships with students from all over the U.S. I’m quite attached to Bridge now, and look forward to learning more. I can’t wait for next year’s tournament!</td>

													<td>Hakan</td>
													<td>I knew a lot of the bridge players in the collegiates from past nationals, and knew UMD had a tough road ahead to make the top 8. The thing I wanted most out of Atlanta was for everyone to like bridge more than before they came to the tournament. As the coach, I also wanted to ensure everyone played as equal as an amount of possible to get as much out of the experience since we were 6-handed. I couldn’t have been more proud of the UMD squad and how far they had come, with three of the members joining the bridge club and playing bridge seriously in the Fall. </td>
